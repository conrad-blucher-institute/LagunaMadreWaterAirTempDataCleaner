# A 10-Year Metocean Dataset for Laguna Madre, Texas Including for the Study of Extreme Cold Events
## Content
This is a data repository. Its main goal is to provide processed and machine learning ready data. This repository contains both raw and post process Air Temperature (ATP) and Water Temperature (WTP). Additionally of containing the data, this repository also contains the code used to process the data.

## Publication
Journal paper currently under review. Once it is published, the citation will be added here.
